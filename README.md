# Speaking Grandma

Write a speakToGrandma function.

Whatever you say to grandma, she should respond with
HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
unless you shout it (type in all capitals).

If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so)
and yells back

NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

To run the specs follow these commands:

```shell
$ learn  # runs only in the terminal
$ learn -b # runs also in the browser
```
